    <h1>Profile &amp; Research Overview</h1>
    <p>
      I led a project at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, applying the Reduced Basis Method to streamline high-dimensional nuclear many-body interactions into manageable two-level systems. This work, in collaboration with the Theory Alliance at FRIB, contributed to a chapter in <em>Quantum Computing Applications in Nuclear Physics</em>, where RBM reductions enabled Bloch sphere representations and quantum gate assembly for Qiskit-based simulations.

      At the Center of Applied Quantum Technology in Stuttgart, I designed VHDL/Verilog PID controllers on Xilinx FPGAs for optical levitation, and at ATF Cooling GmbH, I built Red Pitaya FPGA controllers with high-speed ADC/DAC interfaces to stabilize industrial chillers using adaptive algorithms.

      In experimental nanofabrication, I worked in cleanrooms to create Josephson junctions, mastering photolithography, etching, sputtering, and ion milling. I performed DC Josephson measurements with SQUIDs, investigating Fraunhofer-pattern phase shifts and mechanisms of critical current suppression such as spin-triplet pairing and ferromagnetic exchange.

      My computational physics experience includes training message-passing neural networks at the Institute for Computer Physics in Stuttgart to predict material properties, demonstrating how graph neural networks can rival traditional quantum simulations in efficiency and accuracy.
